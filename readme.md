Implemented pix2pix [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004.pdf) for image translation. Final [presentation](https://github.com/iWrote/pix2pix4plateGen/blob/master/Synthetic%20data%20generation%20using%20GANs.pptx) (.ppt).
#### Problem: Creating fake (but realistic) images to train an automated number plate recognition program. Because we don't have enough real ones. Procedural generation is not allowed.

#### and for fun (a simple GAN getting better at faking handwritten numbers)
